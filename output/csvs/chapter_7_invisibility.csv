I prefer to be invisible,"Is this an ADHD thing or just a me thing? I feel like it’s related to masking.

I’m a basically attractive older woman and have always been popular, with a few close friends and a larger social circle. I’m often asked to represent my company and speak publicly (which I hate). I don’t enjoy birthday parties that celebrate me—though I love cake and presents with my family. I dreaded my wedding’s first dance and walking down the aisle, but my spouse made it bearable.

I enjoy my own company and am never bored. But when I’m out in public alone, I’d rather not be seen. I’ll stay in my hotel room (I travel a lot for work) or at home and go without something just to avoid going out. It’s not that I’m embarrassed to be alone—I just want to be invisible.

When I travel alone, I put up the Do Not Disturb sign and prefer housekeeping not to come, even if I’m out.

Right now, we’re visiting my husband’s hometown. He’s with the kids, and it took me two hours to convince myself to go out for coffee.",1422,ADHDwomen,https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jclqgu/i_prefer_to_be_invisible/,Seeking Advice

I asked her for a reference and she obliged, but seemed surprised that I would need that. I got home and started crying because I’m so tired of having to work so hard to remember anything. 

This happens with pretty much everything in my life unless I have some kind of external reference or have done it so much that I know it by heart. Even with things that I’m genuinely interested in and love! 

I don’t know. I know logically I’m not dumb, but having poor working memory certainly makes me feel that way sometimes. Ugh, it’s been a bad brain day.

And I guess l've fallen down a rabbit hole trying to understand how controlled substance supplies are managed. I'm hoping someone here with policy or medical expertise can shed some light on this, because it seems counterintuitive.

What I could gather from the public meeting and related documents is that the DEA predicts the entire country's medical need for drugs like morphine or benzodiazepines for a full year. Based on this prediction they set a hard national limit on how much can be manufactured. If a legitimate shortage occurs mid year or before the year ends (due to a flu outbreak, manufacturing issues, etc.) the limit cannot be easily or quickly changed.

The danger of Gabor Mate’s perspective for ADHD Women,"I’m writing to see if it has affected any of you. 

I first read Gabor Mate’s In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts before I was diagnosed (at 29). I found it deeply inspiring, authentic, and real. It gave me hope for destigmatising addiction, particularly coming from personal experience with addiction in my family. 

I continued to follow him, listen to interviews, read other books. He was a bit of an inspiration for me. 

When I got diagnosed, I grieved, hard. I thought I’d feel relief (medication has changed my life), but I felt deep sadness, and anger. Like others, I absolutely hyperfixated on ADHD social media, studies, books, finding a community where I could take off the neurotypical masks that I thought would be permanently cemented to my face.

Small packing tip that’s helped me stop worrying if I’ve forgotten to pack something,"I’m just packing to go away and I’ve actually remembered to use a system that helps me so I thought I’d share it with you gals!

This is especially helpful when I don’t have a packing list ready to check things off to confirm what I’ve packed. Plus I often forget to check off things off the list anyway. 

I’ve found this is soooo helpful when I’ve already zipped everything up or we’ve already set off and need to double check something. I can just look at this list instead of having to dig everything out again in a panic!

They recognized the inattentive ADHD symptoms I reported, but because my mom didn’t score me as highly, they said that was the main factor that led to me not being diagnosed.

Fell down the DMN and TPN hole. I have a whole new perspective now on ADHD.,"For those who might want to understand what your brain is doing during your hyper-fixations, paralysis and distractions: getting to know how the Default Mode Network and the Task Positive Network in your brain works is helpful.

Essentially, the Default Mode Network is active when you are daydreaming, anxious, introspective, planning for the future and replaying the past. In a neurotypical person, they can switch to the Task Positive Network when they need to initiate and complete a task. In the neurotypical person, these two networks act like a toggle, never being active at the same time.

However, in a person with ADHD, these two systems don't function properly. And surprise surprise, Dopamine is key in making these work correctly. In an ADHD person, they are on at the same time. It's why you have trouble focusing. You are trying to finish a task, but this default mode network is buzzing in your brain. These two networks are clashing, making it difficult to do what you need to do.

Social media's ADHD isn't mine,"  My FYP has been listening to my conversations with my husband about his ADHD for a few years now. And being in the psychology realm, the online content has always included ADHD at some capacity.  

Recently, videos on YouTube and Tiktok have been showing up more and more. Prolly because I've now been diagnosed. 

None of these illustrations of ADHD at all match what I have experienced. Or even what my husband has experienced.

They also all seem so infantilizing. Or make people with ADHD out to be idiots who need hand holding in neatly every aspect of their lives.  

These are creators who claim to have ADHD.. and maybe they do and this is just how *they* experienced it. 

But I can't help to think that it's performative at worst, or just not something relatable at best.  

It isn't until I actually seek out ADHD content that I see anything relatable.  

And, I really think this is part of why I didn't know I had it.

ADHD hacks that ACTUALLY work for me,"Share yours in the comments- I hope some of these are useful 🩷

1. hyper-focusing and then becoming overwhelmed
we all have those moments where we decide to clean the whole house and end up with more mess.
i prefer to focus on one task in one room to avoid losing motivation - e.g ""clean the sink"" instead of ""clean the kitchen.""
Then, I am not forced to carry on sorting out massive messes once the sink is done, unless I actually want to/have the energy.

2. getting up in the morning (especially in winter)

i use this alarm clock from Lumie. it creates a fake ""sunrise"" in your room at the time you set it to - as if you're waking up naturally from light.
I like to set it half an hour - an hour before I need to get up

The Invisible Wall,"(translated from my native tongue)  
  
Four years have passed since I first—purely by chance—came across the acronym ADHD. It turned out to be something that was, is, and will remain, for the rest of my life, a wall in my path: a wall I will keep running into, again and again, and one I will never truly leap over. I can only come to terms with the fact that a quirk of nature placed it directly in front of me, and that no piece of advice along the lines of “just try harder” will ever tear it down. All that remains is to accept that this article is written by a different kind of brain. Fine. A minor detail. But…

How am I supposed to accept all the consequences that life with undiagnosed ADHD has left on me?

However, as I've spent more and more time with Matthew, I've begun to notice that he doesn't seem to really notice and/or care when other people are upset, sad, or angry, especially when it has to do with things he does and says.

The negative side of Matthew's personality can be summarized by an interaction that me and him quite literally had two days ago:

Me: *looking in my folder at a poster I made for a composting project for my science class. It has some girls from an anime game I like on it*

Matthew: What are you playing? What the hell's that?

The exhaustion of living in cognitive translation,"Some brains think sequentially. Step A leads to step B leads to step C.

Some brains think holistically. All the information synthesizes at once into complete understanding.

Guess which one professional culture has decided is the only ""legitimate"" way to think?

If your brain works through pattern recognition, associative connections, parallel processing? You're constantly translating. Taking insights that arrived as complete pictures and reverse-engineering them into sequential explanations. Every meeting. Every project plan. Every time someone asks ""but how did you get there?""

This translation work is invisible, unacknowledged, exhausting.

And when you can't translate fast enough or clearly enough, your insights get dismissed. Even when you're consistently proven correct later.

We've built workplaces that only validate one cognitive style. Everyone else pays a tax just to participate.

Discussion: Is using terms like hyperfixation for neurodivergents only or do you think its okay for neurotypicals to use them too?,"I think it irks me a bit when neurotypicals use them since most of the time they don't know the true volume of what these things mean.

Overstimulated is one that bothers me less as long as its used in the right context. Pisses me off when they say overstimulated instead of overwhelmed though since they're different things and often the situation calls for overwhelmed being the word to use and not overstimulated.

Shortness Deficit Disorder (...the Doorframes Model of Disability),"(I wrote this for LinkedIn and someone said this subreddit might appreciate it)

""Shortness Deficit Disorder"": Why we are talking about Neurodiversity all wrong.

If you hit your head on a doorframe, are you 'suffering' from height? Or is the door just too low? Recent UK political debate on the ""over-diagnosis"" of neurodivergent conditions is missing the point. We are debating the medical validity of the headache, while ignoring the architecture that causes it...

The headlines swirl about rising demand for ADHD and Autism assessments. Is there overdiagnosis? Are we pathologising 'normal difficulties'? Are we constraining people with labels for life? Are we actually supporting people with real problems and needs?

And I feel a deep frustration. We are trying to solve a design and empathy problem using the language of disease. The drama flows from a fundamental error: we have mistakenly applied the concepts of illness to the realities of human variation.

Society’s Disability: The Failure to See Neurodivergent Genius,"

*I wrote this for my son and every other child who experiences the same*



Who decided what was ""normal,"" and for what purpose? It is society that has the disability—the inability to see beyond the cage we call ""normal."" My son does not have a disability; I see him as having a superpower. He possesses a brilliance that is overlooked by a system that prioritizes conformity over creativity, obedience over original thought. Society has created a world where children like my son are labelled as “less than,” when in truth, they have the ability to see beyond the very systems that confine us.

**The Script of Disability**

Education, in its current form, is outdated. Schools operate under a script designed for an economic machine, one that benefits the few while failing the many. Neurodivergent children, like my son, challenge this system—not because they are broken, but because they do not fit into it. Rather than seeing this as an opportunity to evolve, the system labels them as problem",32,neurodiversity,https://reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1iwipdt/societys_disability_the_failure_to_see/,Inspirational

I've been noticing something among ND individuals, and I'd like to know if anyone else had noticed.

I've realized that whenever something negative happens, like:
 *- the ND person has a short temper;
 *- the ND person is unable to take care of themselves;
 *- the ND person commits a crime;

... then suddenly all the blame for that is placed on their neurodivergence, while every other factor in existence gets mysteriously removed.

For example *(example made up)*: An ND adult cannot cook, and the general opinion is that is because of his autism. But then, digging deeper, you discover that the adult's parents didn't even attempt to teach him at least some cooking skills *(or get someone to do it for them)*, it's like they expected him unable to do so from the start.
Of course, this second part where it's stated that their parents basically coddled them gets ignored, and instead all of the blame is placed on the individual's autism.

I (34 F) was just diagnosed with ADHD today. I knew for a long time, particularly after my autism assessment, so getting the diagnosis wasn't much of a shock. 

I told several close friends, who were incredibly supportive. I then told my Dad, and the first thing he asked was, ""are you taking medication for it?"" I lied and said no. ""Good,"" he replied. ""I heard they have bad side effects. Your aunt had bad side effects."" My aunt has manic / depressive bipolar and doesn't take her medication consistently. My parents aren't the most emotionally available people, and they tend to choose ignorance when big feelings come up, so I wasn't surprised by this response. This usually softens with time. 

My parents tend to look online for info they want to see, and less so for facts. And it'",71,ADHD,https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1kkqy13/my_parents_are_pretty_ignorant_about_adhd_any/,Supportive
My TEDx Talk on the Invisible Struggle of ADHD in Women & Girls – Sharing My Story to Raise Awareness,"Hey everyone, I recently had the opportunity to give a TEDx talk on a topic that’s deeply personal to me—how ADHD presents differently in women and girls and why so many go undiagnosed for years. As someone who has experienced these challenges firsthand, I wanted to shed light on the misconceptions and advocate for better awareness.

If you’ve ever felt overlooked, misunderstood, or struggled with ADHD yourself, I’d love for you to check it out and share your thoughts! Let’s start a conversation about the importance of proper diagnosis and support.

Here’s the link to my talk: https://youtu.be/Px_EPsMt71Y?si=s0SDteTuFRLusILW

Most underrated skill with adhd,"What’s the most underrated skill that people with ADHD have, apart from pattern recognition?

Hey everyone, I was wondering—what do you think is the most underrated or overlooked skill that people with ADHD naturally have, that maybe others don’t?

I often hear about pattern recognition, but I’m curious what else you think stands out.

I feel like i was so bubbly and was able to go to anyone and start a chat. Chip in and give my 2 cents. 
But the last  years i've honestly felt so disconnected. Nearly like i have social anxiety, but in the sense where I don't know how to connect with my friends. 

It doesn't help that my memory is shit and that I can't remember the stuff my friends have been saying. So I don't want to ask them and I don't know what topic to bring up because I can't remember if we've talked about it or not.

Psychiatrist told me he thinks ADHD isnt real,"So i had an appointment today with a psychiatrist for anxiety. I brang up ADHD and the possibility of having it, and he shook his head and said;

Yeah, um... I am probably not the right person to talk to about that because I don't believe ADHD is real."" He then said anxiety and other mental disorders can mimic ADHD symptoms, and adhd treatment is stimulants which makes anxiety 1000x worse. So a big no no.

It's not that I don't want to respond. It's that every time I open my phone to reply, my brain just... freezes. The longer I wait, the worse it gets. Now I need to explain why I took so long, which makes the response even harder to write, so I don't write it, which makes it worse.

People think I'm ignoring them. They think I'm being rude or don't care. But I'm just paralyzed. The task of responding feels insurmountable even though I know logically it takes 30 seconds. I was playing jackpot city on my laptop last night and saw someone had texted me asking if I was okay since I'd been quiet.

I even talked about how much I relate to people with ADHD when I read about their struggles, but every time she ignores me and tells me I do not have ADHD because i’ve been doing good in life and I’ve achieved great things!

I hate how unseriously ADHD is taken,"It's upsetting that ADHD isn't perceived as it should be. When it comes to other cognitive conditions such as autism and depression, despite being joked about and parodied on the internet (which is also not right), they are still taken seriously for the most part when someone actually has it in real life. But with ADHD that's not the case. People don't understand the full extent of how it affects us in every way mentally, emotionally, socially, physically etc, because most people just have this watered down idea of ""they're hyper"" when it's so much more than that.

This is why it hurts so much to have comments made like ""stop attention seeking"" when I try to explain that ADHD is the reason for why I am the way I am, because most people just have this notion of ADHD just being this quirky little trait, and are ignorant to just how deeply it affects us.

I hate how internet culture has created this oversimplification of what ADHD is. I really wish people were better understanding.

I brought up how the first week felt great, but it felt less effectiver as the month went on. (30mg)

I was expecting a ""That's great!"" response, but instead I got ""The intense reaction makes sense after not taking stimulants for so long, but some of that sounds like a placebo effect.""

Then it’s two days. Now I start worrying and it feels like an obligation. Then it’s four days and I start wondering what I’m even supposed to say or how I’m going to explain the delay.

At that point it turns into something embarrassing. So I archive the message so I don’t have to see it. I tell myself I’ll definitely reply later. And sometimes… I just never do.

Is there a way to maybe set reminders I can't flipping ignore? I thought of maybe making my phone's background a list of things I need to do but then I'd need to change it all the time.

How to really use a calendar and not ignore reminders?!,"Hello, I really struggle in my life. I try to be productive by using calendars like time-blocking, alarms, and reminders to remind me of the tasks I need to do. However, I don't know how to make myself actually use these calendars. For example, notifications pop up on my phone saying ""skincare time"" or ""lesson planning time"" (I am an online teacher), but I just ignore them and continue with my life. Nothing seems to work for me. I tried body doubling online, but I end up ignoring attending the session. I know that's not good. I also tried an app called ""Rotinary"" to remind me of my skincare routine and other habits I struggle with, but I ignore the alarm.

"Feeling stuck, ignored, and useless at work","Hello everyone,

I really need your advice about a painful situation I’m going through right now.

I’m currently working as a PMO, but when I took the role, they told me it was a Project Manager position which turned out to be false. I'm working through a consulting company for a client, and my actual tasks are mostly about chasing people constantly for updates or actions.

The worst part is: most of the time they don’t reply at all. I get ignored every day, especially now that my badge has been deactivated for two months. I can’t even go on site, so I have to follow up remotely and that just makes people ignore me even more.

Why is adhd treated as less of a disability,"It honestly blows my mind how little people understand ADHD. Everyone thinks it’s just being “hyper” or “bad at focusing,” but they don’t see how it affects every part of your life. Forgetting to eat, zoning out in conversations, not being able to start simple tasks, feeling like your brain is in 100 directions at once—these aren’t personality quirks. They’re real symptoms that make daily life exhausting.

And the worst part is how people treat you when you try to explain it. You get told to “just try harder,” “use a planner,” or “everyone has trouble focusing.” It’s so invalidating. ADHD isn’t about laziness—it’s a neurological condition that can cause depression, anxiety, burnout, and serious self-esteem issues when it’s ignored or untreated.

I wish more people understood that ADHD is real and deserves compassion, not judgment. Just because someone looks “normal” on the outside doesn’t mean their brain isn’t fighting to keep up every single day.",545,ADHD,https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oadcmv/why_is_adhd_treated_as_less_of_a_disability/,Fed Up

Are ADHD “Subtypes” Still Meaningful if We Can’t Biologically Distinguish Them?,"Hi, I’m a primary teacher with ADHD myself, and I work closely with children (since 20 years), sometimes also with adolescents, and adults who are affected by it. That shapes my perspective, but I’m very open to being challenged.

I’m increasingly unsure how meaningful the traditional ADHD subtypes actually are. We cannot map these categories biologically, and there is no neurobiological marker that reliably separates a “hyperactive/impulsive type” from an “inattentive type.” The DSM-5 dropped the subtype concept for a reason and moved to “presentations,” because they tend to shift over time and are diagnostically unstable.

I also notice a practical problem. Many children, teenagers, and adults start to place themselves into these boxes and then overlook what actually helps them. Some who think of themselves as “inattentive only” do not realise how much they benefit from movement or physical activation.

This discrepancy suggests that social presentation style rather than the substantive content of social speech drove negative impression formation of individuals with ASD. Supporting this conclusion, a static image was sufficient for generating negative first impressions of those with ASD and including additional information, such as body movement or voice, did not worsen them further.”

"I've noticed that the existence of low empathy autistic folks is kind of ignored by the autistic community a lot, or at least it feels like we are","To preface, I do understand why. The stereotype of autistic folks all being ""unfeeling, unempathetic robots"" is prevelent and pretty harmful, so I understand the need to emphasise the existence and prevelence of high empathy autistic individuals to fight back against it. I get it, I do, but I can't help but feel a bit isolated and ignored by the community sometimes

I don't think it's a bad thing to have low empathy, yet it feels like that trait is often buried and ignored to focus on more easily digestible, desirable ""human"" characteristics that neurotypicals will accept easier, such as high empathy. And neurotypicals don't often seem to realise we can struggle with high empathy as well, so I do believe it is important to bring up so that the less represented members of our community aren't misunderstood, but sometimes I feel like we try too hard to separate ourselves from autistic stereotypes and it just feels isolating.

Obviously, if you’ve read even a small amount of information regarding this, then you know this is bogus.

Roommate A (normal hearing) hears it now and then, thinks “Huh, weird,” and moves on. The fan still works. She barely notices it. The problem exists, but it doesn’t register as a real issue. So she forgets it.

Why are there so many places that advertise catering to kids with autism and not adults too?,"I often see hairdressers, dentists etc that are catered to ‘children with autism’ or say they are happy to make accomodations for kids with autism. I recently came across a hairdresser salon being advertised that was specifically catering to autistic and neurodivergent folk and got excited but when I looked up the website it was clear that it was a salon for only children and not adults. 

Why is it always just children? Do they not know that children with autism grow up to be adults with autism and we also need accomodations? 

Sometimes I feel like adults with autism get forgotten about, or like we are invisible. Or because we are adults we are expected to just deal with our sensory issues and get over it.

Do you ever feel invisible?,"How do I explain it:
You have all these thoughts and feelings and you want to contribute—you want to be heard but you’re invisible.

You sit in a group of people, each exchanging ideas, and like a game of duck duck goose you’re waiting for your turn, but you’re never called on. And you wait and you think maybe they’ll acknowledge you, maybe you’re overthinking it. But it happens again. And again. Different people. Places. Then people say, maybe it’s a problem with you. So you change your approach, you change your mask. But it happens again. And again.

Today, during our daily meetings, when it came my turn to speak, I was skipped, the person after me was called on to speak. The person after me said I was skipped, but the organizer of the group proceeded, then circled back to me.

A small thing, logically I know this, and this has happened only once—so far— but the same act builds up over time and you wonder: why am I invisible?

My Autistic buddy did the math. I’ve been sharing this everywhere to combat the ignorance.,"How autism math actually works:

Autism rate now: 1:31
Autism rate in 2000: 1:150
Rate of severe autism among autistic population: ~25%

As the year 2000 diagnostic criteria basically only counted severe autism as autism, and as the current diagnostic criteria of autism includes the year 2000 diagnostic criteria of autism, PDD, and Aspergers; we must do some math to see what the actual change in the severe autism rate is to see if there is an epidemic that isn’t explained by changing the diagnostic criteria

Calculating the rate of severe autism in the US currently, we have: ~1:124.

“Severe” Autism made up about 0.67% of the population in 2000.

Today, that rate is 0.81%.

This is an increase of ~0.14 percentage points over 25 years.  

Even this smalll increase could likely be explained by the changing of the diagnostic criteria.

There isn’t an epidemic.",2222,autism,https://reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1k6yhix/my_autistic_buddy_did_the_math_ive_been_sharing/,Inspirational

Meanwhile, I'm over here about to throw up it's so loud. She asks me to lead her to the sound, and I do. She says she'll fix it, which she does, and I thank her.

There is a problem with accountability in this community.,"In the Reddit autism community, there is a growing problem with accountability and misplaced blame. A common example is when people claim they were fired because they are autistic, even though they never disclosed their diagnosis to their employer. While workplace discrimination absolutely exists and should be taken seriously, it is unrealistic to assume autism was the reason for termination if the employer was never informed. Criticism of systemic issues loses credibility when personal responsibility is ignored.

Another issue is the hostility toward neurotypical (NT) people simply for being NT. Generalizing NTs as ignorant, malicious, or inherently harmful mirrors the same unfair stereotyping autistic people experience. That kind of thinking doesn’t challenge prejudice—it reinforces it. No group is morally superior just because of neurological differences.

The Woman History Erased: Grunya Sukhareva discovered autism 20 years before Kanner and Asperger.,"Before Hans Asperger or Leo Kanner, a Jewish-Ukrainian psychiatrist named Grunya Sukhareva defined autism in 1925. She included girls and understood the neurology decades before anyone else. Today, the education system and ""intersectional"" activists ignore her because they are too busy using Hans Asperger as a ""sexist villain,"" completely glossing over the fact that he was a literal eugenicist who sent children to their deaths.

The Body of the Post
Most of us are taught that autism research started in the 1940s with two men. That is a lie. In 1925, Grunya Sukhareva published the first clinical descriptions of autistic children. She was a pioneer who:

Included girls from the start (1927), while the ""Founding Fathers"" claimed autism was a male-only condition.

Identified sensory issues and motor clumsiness that the DSM didn't fully recognize for decades.

It explicitly says that in Level 2 and 3 people, autism is always noticeable, regardless of context (""*social impairments apparent even with supports in place*""), which seems quite logical to me.

When should I ignore the feeling “I want to rest right now” ?,"I think I have alexithymia because In the moment I can usually only name feelings like “upset” “good” and “tired”. The issue is, I feel tired a lot of the time, probably most of the time. There are a lot of things I do when I’m tired, and a lot of times I push things back in the schedule because I’m tired. My question is, when is it an appropriate time to push through feeling like I want to rest? Does it depend on how tired I am or how long it’s been or how sick or mentally tired I feel? Because physical tired and mental tiredness are different, maybe one is one I should ignore and push through and the other I should respect.

Do People Ignore Your Texts or Topics Within Them?,"It seems like often times when I ask people I know if they would like to get together sometime, they either don’t respond or dodge the topic if I include that as part of a text message.

Truly invisible or very subtle earplugs,"Many years ago (long before anyone knew why I had sensory issues) I bought a pair of genuinely ear shaped, flat (mostly), (white) flesh tone hunting earplugs that were very subtle, but because of that, if you looked closely they looked almost medical. I really think it was the reason I wasn't questioned about having something in my ears during a very very high level, restricted testing session. I have never found them again. I think it's because the market has been flooded with all the hype around Loops and similar products and because people are now more serious about protecting their hearing and wearing more ear protection of all colors, which is great! For personal reasons, though, if anyone knows where I could find something like this again, that would be incredible!!

Sometimes they even ignore my message and just post something right after it.

I keep asking myself if there’s something wrong with me, and honestly, I’m getting increasingly tired of trying to interact (though I know it’s probably unhealthy doing this). I’ve been careful not to send too many messages or post things out of context, but it still keeps happening with different people. At this point, I feel like I just don’t have real connections anymore.

Has Alexithymia helped mask your anxiety?,"I have a pretty bad case of social anxiety; over the years (decades), as I've become more and more emotionally muted, the clear, obvious effects of my phobia have mostly gotten thinner and thinner, more easily ignored.

But even though I can feel it and I know it's there (and in the past it would cripple me and cause me panic attacks), now I can still function, still socialize, still have normal conversations. I can hold it all within me without experiencing the side-effects of fighting against your phobia.

I've been in pain most of my life and I didn't even know it. The low energy of chronic pain drains you from wanting to expend more energy on anything and that doubly so for my emotions. I became numb to everything but extreme sadness and anger.

I have always been neurodivergent but this was another level. The pain was like a vice on my mind causing me to have a harder time making concise thoughts. This made it harder to pin down the emotions I was feeling to the overwhelming anxiety. It was only once I removed this anxiety that my pain level was low enough I could start to access my real emotions again.

For 33 years, my true voice was trapped inside. It was shame. It was silence. It was told it wasn’t real.

At 33, it broke through. I spoke the truth for the first time. But instead of being heard, I was erased. My ex-wife, her family, and the system boxed me away again. My children were turned against me. Another man stepped in to be called “dad.”

My kids have never truly heard my real voice. They look through me as if I don’t exist. But I have always been here. Every day, I fight battles unseen just to stay present — not just as a man, but as their father.

Alexithymia and the auditory visual feedback loop,"
I’ve been thinking more and more about Alexithymia and wanted to share my thoughts, as well as reflect on them. Over the years, by reading forums, I’ve noticed that there seems to be a constellation of cognitive traits and styles that could make our emotional experience quite different (neurodiverse peope) . I want to comment on what I think are the most important ones and how they contribute to a different way of approaching emotions.

First of all, I’ve observed that we are very sensory in nature. Not only do we have a highly visual thinking style—even though many people with Alexithymia have aphantasia—but I would argue that aphantasia, which means limited imagination, is often a result of being shut down by trauma. There could potentially be a way to reinstate or reactivate it. But beyond the visual aspect, there’s also a strong auditory component. Many people think and learn by speaking out loud, needing to verbalize their words to fully understand a situation or make sense of so",4,Alexithymia,https://reddit.com/r/Alexithymia/comments/1ii7hnp/alexithymia_and_the_auditory_visual_feedback_loop/,Neutral
Suppressed feelings and writing in all caps,"
I’ve been having some ideas around trauma, intensity or loudness of the inner voice, passionate energy, and calling out unfair or immoral behavior, or just in general expressing suppressed emotions. I’m still experimenting with everything, but I’m also writing this post to get feedback—other people’s thoughts, experiences, and perspectives.

What I’ve noticed is that, for many neurodivergent people, there’s an innate potential for passionate energy and intensity, but society normalizes not caring, appearing cool, and valuing stoicism as the ideal way to behave. This discourages people from expressing intense, authentic emotion, and over time, it can dial down or mute their inner voice.

Even in terms of autonomy, I think it’s important to raise the volume of the inner voice again, to find ways to amplify it rather than suppress it. One method I’ve been exploring is journaling—but in caps lock.

Alexithymia and describing psychological harm,"I’ve been having some more reflections around fairness in neurodivergence and tying it to the idea of descriptive realism—where you use language in a very concrete way to describe your sensory experiences, including sounds, images, and the situation in front of you.

What I’ve noticed is that you can apply this very concrete, literal, descriptive thinking style to describing psychological harm. Many neurotypical people do not explicitly state the type of harm that occurs in interactions. When someone bullies another person, or says something offensive, or disregards someone, psychological harm is inflicted—but it often goes unstated.

I find it very useful, even on a bodily level, to explicitly describe these situations. For example:

“He is ignoring that person.”

“He is not taking into account what the other person is saying.”

“ He is trying to make that person look bad by intentionally lying about what the other person said”

Why does society treat invisible struggles like ADHD as character flaws?,"When a neurodivergent person struggles with social communication, sensory processing, or needs clear routines, we (as educators, parents, society) generally respond supportively  make accommodations. We say ""they can't help it, they need different approaches."" And we're right to do this.

When a student has ADHD and struggles with task initiation, working memory, or emotional regulation. The response is often different. The response is frustration. Impatience. Disappointment.

'They just need to try harder.'

Planners and reminders are suggested (strategies that require the exact executive functions they're struggling with).

'Do they really have ADHD or are they just lazy?'

Both are neurodevelopmental conditions and both involve brains that work differently from the neurotypical majority.

Both require understanding and support.

**PROLOGUE**  
ADHD is a condition whose effects are, let’s be honest, very Instagrammable, very funny: how hilarious is it to watch the video of an ADHD guy who can’t even fill his glass of water because he’s distracted by a thousand things? AHAHA, pure laughs.

But we’re talking about real people here, especially those diagnosed as adults, who have spent their lives being bullied by a society that forgives nothing—a society that made perfection (which doesn’t exist) the universal standard, and that boosts itself by kicking those already down just to feel superior and walk into church more serenely. ADHD is a biological condition, a different way the brain works; it’s not something you “cure,” it’s something you learn to **manage** (if you have it) and **accept** (if you don’t). Often, it also becomes a psychological burden, and no kidding: try living your life being constantly ",64,ADHDers,https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1oa2jbk/im_50_and_just_got_diagnosed_with_adhd_here_are/,Neutral

"Making up plans and strategies to be productive and manage my life, only to not follow them.","Several years ago in my 2nd year of high school, I started using a calendar to manage tasks over time. It helped, but I made inconsistent progress—doing a little bit of this here and a little bit of that there. What I needed was a **structure** to help me be consistent. So I started out with some basic, typical stuff like: ""I will do this thing once a week"", ""every morning I will do this"", ""I will focus on this on Mondays and this on Tuesdays and this on Wednesdays…"", designating ""off days"" to relax, etc. None of that stuff panned out. I straight-up ignored the schedule and just made pretty much every day my off day, except for when I worked hard as fuck seemingly randomly (which I later learned was hyperfocus).

Over the years since, I’ve devised numerous *New-and-Improved Ultimate Productivity Strategies*™ to finally get my shit together and be productive, all of which I either (a) didn’t execute at all or (b) stopped following soon after (read: a few days) after I started them.

I effed up (funny/not funny),"I was really unfocused when I got my diagnosis  last September and misinterpreted my doctor. I was as focused as I'm now, almost can't muster energy to write this.

He made the impression I would have to wait 1 year before I see him, I didn't listen if he said I was going to speak to a nurse, doctors handle prescriptions so I didn't connect it then and there.

I was supposed to start medication right then, never got an prescription and he never booked a nurse for me. I went on to this week and wondered why I didn't get an appointment so I made the call. Then the misunderstanding and error on their part became apparent, no one bothered to check up on me - someone who have been forgotten several times already, we have a 90 day guarantee for healthcare queues. They even had me do the same more than twice because the psychiatrist didn't bother looking for the old tests.

I want a ‘sticky note’ on my Lock Screen!,"

I have so many reminders set that I don’t pay attention to them (in the medical field we call that “alarm fatigue”).  So that doesn’t work for me.

How to get over annoying interactions with random people?,"Hi. So I just visited a concert. There was a guy who was already drunk before the concert even started, but in a good mood. He was in front of me and danced. Like many drunk people, he didn't noticed that he was moving backwards while dancing. Slightly, but moving. At some point, I couldn't move away from him any further because behind me was a desk. So I lifted my arm and put it on his back and so he couldn't come closer. I didn't want him on my feet and neither did I want his dunken ass any closer to me - literally. I did not put much pressure on him, just enough so he would notice. I am a small women and he was a bigger guy btw.

He turned around and asked ""Why do you PUSH me???"" Before I could explain to him that I didn't push him but just wanted to make him aware that he was getting too close he got really angry, insulting me, telling me to ""leave him alone"" (even though he was the one talking to me lol) and after a bit more of his frustation he left to another spot.

Struggling with ADHD med shortages? Please sign & share this petition 💊,"Hey ADHDers,

Like a lot of you, I’ve been dealing with endless “out of stock” messages at pharmacies for Vyvanse, Adderall, and other ADHD meds. Some people are even being told to go to the ER when they can’t get their prescription filled. It’s unsafe, exhausting, and honestly dehumanizing.

I started a petition asking California to **declare a public health emergency on ADHD medication shortages.** The goal is to push leaders to:

* Track and publicly report which pharmacies actually have stock
* Let pharmacists fill equivalent dosages when your usual script isn’t available
* Require insurance to approve emergency gap prescriptions without red tape
* Pressure the DEA/FDA to raise national stimulant quotas so supply meets real demand

Should I get a second opinion ?? or am I overthinking this. any advice please,"I am 30m, was 8 months ago where I went to doctor, firstly regarding TICs and then regarding possibility if ADHD. either way we talked about everything, classic traits and so on, and made another follow up. 

in the follow up she advised I was a bit of everything regarding ADHD. and prescribed Wellbutrin for start, just to try.

It helped for start and then got less and less, over time... now taking 450mg last couple of months and I feel its absolutely doing nothing to the core ADHD traits.. other than just giving me some energy, which does help in its own way.


I went today to discuss this, and she all of a sudden advised these or even the common traits we talked about is nothing to do with ADHD, its just the person I am. and a person with ADHD would say Wellbutrin did not help them at all, but since it helps me in some way (bit of energy boost i guess), it means it could have been depression of sorts.

Why most undiagnosed people don’t really understand ADHD (and it’s not why you might expect).,"This is a pretty long post, but I think it’ll help a lot of you guys understand non-ADHDers a little bit better.

To start, I’m writing this as (currently) an undiagnosed person. But I’ve still had experiences similar to many of you.

I’ve had countless periods in my life where I tell myself “I’m gonna get this done,” and then proceed to waste hours on social media. I’m really bad at managing time and guessing how long it’s gonna take me to do certain tasks. I face analysis paralysis all the time when I have a bunch of tasks, and sometimes struggle to complete all of them.

A while ago, there was a period of \~3 months where my mind was completely clouded during every waking second. I didn’t understand anything from a particular class I was taking, and regardless of how much time I spent reviewing the material and studying at home, I kept underperforming on the tests. It was one of the worst periods of my life.

Getting back on track,"Hello everyone!! Already feel welcome here just reading the rules and prior posts. I would love some help for people who may do better with the executive function part of ADHD, or have been able to improve it. 

I had been thriving in all honesty. I moved into a new apartment, was keeping it clean, my sleep schedule and quality was fantastic, and I was building a routine. Everything then spiraled after I got hurt playing sports then went on vacation knowing I had my surgery waiting for me the day after I got back since it was urgent to fix but not an emergency. 

I got the surgery and yes things expectedly started to get a little messy and out of order in the first week & 1/2ish post-op. 

We’re approaching week 4 and I feel like everything has crumbled down. My apartment is a mess, my sleep schedule is miserable (both time blindness at night and quality of sleep due to my recovery). It was an arm surgery and I can’t hold anything heavier than my phone with my non dominant arm.

Eye opening day for Vyvanse VS Adderall today.,"So for the past two months I’ve been taking Vyvanse after a couple years on Adderall. I knew from the start it didn’t work as well, but today I found out how not as well, but imma give a quick rundown of the differences.

1. My attention span was improved on Vyvanse, but at 20mg it was objectively not as much as Adderall ER at the same dosage.

2. Vyvanse barely affected my appetite compared to Adderall.

3. Vyvanse didn’t give me the sweats nearly as bad.

4. If I don’t take a Vyvanse, which I tend to skip weekend days if I don’t have anything to do, I am completely useless. NO executive function, the attention span of a gold fish even compared to my unmedicated self, etc.

So today I woke up, I have one Vyvanse left with a doctor’s appointment tomorrow to get more. Three days ago I found basically a whole ass bottle of Adderall that I’d actually forgotten about, typical right? They were 15 mg ER from before I went up to 20 mg over a year ago.

the quirks, the hyperactivity and stimming (self-stimulation), the individual personality flaws and how Owen works through them and finally takes ownership of himself, his learning arch is so similar to my own in the way that I am always so impulsive and learn things the hard way almost every time, and also the FREAKISHLY CALM, thinking-on-the-feet and in-control form under high-stakes high-pressure high-reward crisis situations, the childhood trauma and how that kinda explains the ADHD, the sense of not-belonging, the ostracism, the alienation...

Fighting Ableism and AI Detection Misuse in Higher Education,"**Hi everyone,**

I am a disabled graduate student at the University at Buffalo and I wanted to share something happening that is putting disabled and neurodivergent students especially at risk.

UB is using AI detection tools like Turnitin’s model to accuse students of academic dishonesty based only on an AI score, without human review or proper investigation. This practice is especially harmful to disabled students, many of whom already face communication barriers, bias, and misunderstandings about how we work and learn.

Graduations are being delayed, students are being forced to retake classes, and basic due process is being ignored. We have started a petition asking UB to end the use of unreliable AI in academic cases and protect students' rights.

"Job options, and breathing room to handle symptoms while at work?","Hi All,

Got something on my mind, but it's a bit hard to articulate, so let me know if I can clarify.

For most of my working life I've done part time work in ESL, which has somehow paid the bills. There's a handful of factors that have made it a really good line of work for me, but since visa laws changing in my city (not in the US) work is drying up and to be honest, I am feeling ready for something new.

As succinctly as I can, here are those factors:

* **Breathing room:** I could come in ""early"" (technically covered in pay but realistically it was off the clock), get settled in, prepare the lesson, and sort everything out. I could learn, improve myself, and prepare at my own pace, and extremely importantly, manage ADHD symptoms without anyone even knowing.
* **Limited face time:** Switching between students and colleagues meant that I could manage interactions much better. Preparing alone meant people wouldn't notice my symptoms too. This also meant that I had a higher tolerance ",3,ADHDers,https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1l8i6sa/job_options_and_breathing_room_to_handle_symptoms/,Seeking Advice

Those who have a confirmed diagnosis, can you relate to some of the following, if so, how do you contextualise them in line with ADHD:

1) Bursts of extreme irrational anger. When I have a day of extreme shame at not getting done what I need to / feeling overstimulated or with task paralysis etc I have an intense desire to retreat into one of my obsessions. I wanna curl up alone, listen to music, watch YouTube or ASMR through earphones. When I do have to still do work etc, the slightest noise from a neighbour in their garden, kids playing outside, people even closing their car doors fills me with intense anger.

DAE have a long attention span that causes social issues?,"TL;DR – My ADHD means I'm in a constant state of hyperfocus, which upsets people around me because they feel ignored. I kind of am ignoring them, but diverting my attention is physically painful, and I can’t always do it.
Q: Does anyone else have similar issues? How do you manage socially?

I'm diagnosed with ASD Level 2, ADHD, OCD, dyspraxia, and dyslexia.

People never really question my ADHD diagnosis—probably because of my awful memory and organization. In fact, a teacher once told my sibling she thought I had ADHD, not realizing I was already diagnosed (she forgot because she has ADHD).

That said, my ADHD presents differently than most people I know. I fit more into the theorized ""Over-Focused AD(H)D"" category, meaning I don’t struggle with inattention in the typical way. Instead, I’m basically in permanent hyperfocus—whether it’s on an action or ruminating. Multitasking is impossible for me.

Anyone aware of a browser extension that can stash tabs in this specific way?,"Like many of you I keep a large amount of tabs open in my browser.

I recently had an idea for a browser extension that I might try to create. I don't want to spend a ton of effort creating it if it already exists. I haven't been able to find one that is exactly like my idea. I will detail my idea below:

The extension will implement a queue(?) of stored tabs. It will put two buttons in the extension section in the browser. One button will read ""Tuck"". Clicking it will close the current tab and add it to the back of the queue. The second button will read ""Pop"". Clicking it will open a new tab, navigate to the stored tab at the front of the queue, and remove that tab from the queue.
