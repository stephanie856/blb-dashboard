Tired of executive dysfunction taking over my life,"My executive dysfunction is really ruining my life. I feel like I can’t convince my brain to do anything, especially things that I enjoy doing (like art, writing, even playing video games). If it’s something I need to do, I still procrastinate and often end up screwing myself over (like waiting too long to refill my medication even though I know I need to). I take quick release Adderall but I’m not consistent with it, and when it wears off after a work day, I crash. I’m just barely going through the motions, and then I rot away to sleep or scroll on my phone for hours. 

It’s especially upsetting when it impacts my art. I’ve been an artist for years, but for the last year or two, my executive dysfunction has really kept me from starting or finishing any art projects. It’s to the point that I feel like I’ve regressed in my skills because I just can’t get myself to make anything. When I do suddenly get the motivation, I’m so discouraged when I can’t make something like I used to easily d",25,ADHDwomen,https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1p7uszk/tired_of_executive_dysfunction_taking_over_my_life/,Fed Up
My current psychiatrist doesn’t think I have ADHD.,"I am 30, in Aug 2024 I started school again after dropping out a decade ago and seeing a new therapist for trauma. 

I was attempting working full time and school full time. I had a very hard time, I was just barely passing classes. Overall, STRUGGLING. Talking with my therapist for a few months, she began to suspect I might have ADHD. Symptoms I was describing that I was/am currently having, patterns from childhood leading up into adulthood, after a few months she was urging me to get assessed. My THEN psychiatrist wasn’t real keen on assessing me. She kept wanting to up my anxiety meds. So, I went to a psychologist who deals with ADHD to get assessed (02/2025) and depending on how you look at it… I passed/failed(?) with flying colors. I have ADHD. She had me do tests on the computer, in a book with a pencil, and interviewed a friend from childhood, my partner of 2.5 years, and my supervisor of 2 years at the time.

i’m experiencing a friction between my physical life and my mental landscape,"i think i’ve reached a strange kind of breaking point that’s not dramatic, just quietly unbearable. i keep saying i’m okay because technically i’m doing the right things: meeting with deans, sending the required emails, making mind maps, building structures so i don’t drown. on paper i look like someone regaining control. inside, it feels like my nervous system is glitching.

it’s like i’m split between two versions of myself: the one who knows exactly what should happen next, and the one who physically can’t move. i watch myself from the outside, trying to coax motion out of paralysis. i know that progress is supposed to come from small steps, but even “small” feels enormous right now.

i missed my therapy appointment today because i wrote down the wrong time, and that one mistake felt like proof that i’m losing my grip. i tried to reason with myself—mistakes happen—but it still hit like confirmation that i’m not functional.

Do others experience emotional flatness on ADHD meds long term? What helped you?,"I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and what (if anything) helped.

I’m diagnosed with **ADHD (combined type)** and **Major Depressive Disorder**. I’ve been in a much more stable place mentally since adding Rexulti to Effexor a few months ago — so the depression itself feels better managed. I’m on **50 mg Vyvanse in the morning**, with **2×10 mg Adderall IR as needed** later in the day. It’s working well in terms of focus and functionality, but... I feel **flat**. Like I’m going through the motions and not fully *in* my life.

I used to get that stimulant “lift” — energy, motivation, even a little joy boost. That’s completely gone. I can work, clean, do all the things I need to, but it feels very mechanical. Not depressed. Just flat.

A few questions for those who’ve been on meds long-term:

* Is this “flatness” common after being on stimulants a while?
* Is it just the new normal? Can you still build a full and meaningful life with that feeling in the background?

Feeling very invalidated by Psych,"After many years of suspecting I have ADHD and looking at all the symptoms, I finally got an appointment with a psychiatrist. They asked me some questions, they listened to my story. I'm still very uncomfortable opening up to a new person and at the end they said they didn't feel like my symptoms were ADHD, but that they would medicate me to see if it helped with symptoms.

 They said because I didn't have problems in school, that I went to college, have a good career, and I got married and had a kid that that's not classic ADHD and that don't have the symptoms. Isn't this very old diagnostic criteria?

Doctor wants to change meds,"Okay... so where to begin

I have been on vyvanse for a couple of years now, started at 30mg was taking 70mg.
I tried concerta but i hated the feeling on it
I am currently on leave from work for mental health reasons


It's affected my job severely, my executive function is going hard and i just cant make myself work, im just going through the motions, my anxiety had been off the charts and frozen, but my mood is stable and I've been able to clean my house, mostly.

Since going on leave my doctor lessened my meds to 30mg.
Now, i have noticed my house cleaning ability, focus etc is all waining, i can feel my emotional disregulation becoming more disregulated  and he's talking about taking me off stimulants 

Does anyone take non stimulant drugs? Now im worried about that and how its not gonna help me like stimulants?

My experience as someone with both ASD and ASPD,"Having ASD, I’ve always struggled with social awareness. Reading tone, body language and unspoken intentions doesn’t come naturally to me. But when I pick up that someone’s being hostile or trying to start something, I feel anger immediately. It’s not subtle. I don’t get confused about whether I’m angry, I just am. My emotions are straightforward and raw in that sense.

Where the ASPD comes in is that, outside of that, I don’t really feel much. I don’t experience emotions like love or attachment the way other people describe them. I don’t cry. I don’t feel empathy in a deep way, even when I logically know someone’s hurting. My emotional range is limited, irritation, satisfaction, boredom, maybe amusement. Anything beyond that feels abstract, more like an idea than a feeling.

Embodied Intelligence,"Embodied Intelligence (noun)

1. The inherent cognitive, emotional, and sensory wisdom that arises from an individual’s lived, felt experience in their own body; a form of intelligence that is expressed through movement, perception, instinct, sensation, and relational presence rather than (or in addition to) traditional linguistic, verbal, or analytical reasoning.

2. A holistic intelligence system in which the brain, body, and environment operate as an integrated feedback loop—honoring the role of somatic awareness, sensory processing, nervous system regulation, and primal expression as legitimate and valuable ways of knowing, processing, and responding to the world.

⸻

Usage in context:

“Embodied intelligence is not a lesser form of cognition—it’s a different and equally valid system of processing. It is the genius of the neurodivergent child rocking in rhythm to self-soothe; the autistic adult who reads emotional energy through physical space; the person who knows what’s true not ",6,neurodiversity,https://reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1k1hfw4/embodied_intelligence/,Neutral

Stimming too much,"This is a difficult subject to discuss but I’m going to be honest about it despite embarrassment.

I’d only heard about stimming a few years ago. I know it is a feature of autism but varies quite a bit between individuals, and wondered if anyone has advice for what to do when stimming is problematic or disruptive as an adult. I’ve been a constant stimmer all my life but I thought it was just “bad habits.” One of many epiphanies after learning about autism...

Mainly it is rocking that I have the hardest time controlling. I rock a lot. Like… a lot. As a kid, I would swing on swingsets or ride those rocking horse toys. Starting around four or five, I’d sneak out of bed after my mom went to sleep and rock in a chair when I had insomnia. If I didn’t have a chair or swing or other object to rock with, I’d just rock on my own or bang my head, or bounce my leg or foot if I needed to be discreet.

Is this autistic burnout?,"Hi everyone, to start off, I hope I'm not intruding. I'm fairly certain I'm a trans woman, but I'm still questioning to an extent. With that being said, I've been seriously struggling with my executive functioning, and I'm not entirely sure what's going on.

I've known for quite some time that I'm autistic, and while I've considered before that I might be experiencing autistic burnout, I kept circling back around to ADHD being the cause of my difficulties. I don't really feel motivated to do much of anything, no matter how desperately I want to be. My special interests have felt dull and unappealing, which was absolutely not the case before this episode of what I think is autistic burnout. 

I can't quite explain it, but I'm pretty sure I have PDA, and without special interests in my life, anything I do just feels.... wrong and unnatural.

How Do You Stim? [FAQ],"
#
How does everybody else stim??
#

### Notes
- This list is broad, but not literally exhaustive; stims are idiosyncratic and not a diagnosis of autism on their own
- Many items cross categories (e.g., humming = auditory + vibration)  
- Distinguish regulation-oriented painstims from self-harm by **intent and function** (stimming for relief vs SH for injury)  
- Safety: avoid tissue damage, burns, or joint strain; prefer safer substitutes (chewelry over sleeves, putty over skin, weighted input over head banging)  
- Speak to your healthcare provider if you are unsure whether your stimming is injurious, or for support managing an injurious stim.

### Microstims (covert/subtle)
- Toe curling inside shoes; foot rocking in place  
- Tiny jaw shifts; tongue rolling; tooth tapping  
- Thumb-index rub in pocket; seam rubbing  
- Phone case edge tracing; coin/ring palming  
- Eye micro-saccade patterns; blink pacing  

### Motor (whole-body movement)
- Rocking (standing, seated, on heels)

Is my mom being dismissive with my autism?,"I can't tell if it is my mom is dismissive or maybe I am reading too much in what she said. 

In short next week I have to talk to a head doctor to get them to sign some papers for insurance saying I basically can't work due to my disability, and this let's me get on my dad's insurance. 

Originally I was going to get deep into my situation, but then I got thinking. I'm not there for therapy, and I just need them to tell my dad's insurance I can't work, I have autism, and it isn't going away. So I decided to make a bullet point list on the off chance I forget things. And I will just hand that over to the doctor. 

I had my mom read through it and she said ""I think that is your perspective.""

To me this immediately said she doesn't believe it is true and it is in my head. Like it isn't base in reality. But maybe I'm over thinking it?
