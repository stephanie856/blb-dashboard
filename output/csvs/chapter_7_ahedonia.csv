Dead inside: Obscure hobbies?,"  I’ve got pretty intense adhd but my severe persistent depression is what actually runs my life. Yes I’m medicated, no it doesn’t work, no I don’t have the resources to change things. 
I find I just get very very little enjoyment out of most things and I’ve always kind of been this way. Just either numb or jealous that others live life not-numb. 

I desperately need a hobby that sparks joy but nothing really feels good. It feels like if it doesn’t feel good, it almost is painful. I don’t like colouring, crafting is expensive and I’m not allowed to bring more junk in the house, and decorating is the same story. I can’t focus enough to read books. Meditating stresses me out. Can’t do plants cuz there’s no sunlight in my house. I’m creative, but not talented. I’m poor and have only one friend, who is constantly busy with their hobbies and other friends, so I’m just super lonely and have nothing going for me but the doom scroll. I don’t care about crocheting or learning to cross stitch. I",380,ADHDwomen,https://reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1n5ywpx/dead_inside_obscure_hobbies/,Fed Up
Resetting my Dopamine Addiction - Building a More Analog Life to help manage my ADHD,"So I’m coming here both to ask and give advice to my fellow ADHD women. It’s going to be a long one so bear with me. This past year has been fairly transformative in what I’ve realized works and doesn’t work for me. I hit a point around 30 where I realized I kinda was fed up with not taking myself seriously and getting help and creating systems for myself that aid in me being more self reliant and, in turn, a better person to those around me. I was tired of being late, of losing things, of doomscrolling for hours and not listening to new music or reading books friends had given me or doing any of my hobbies. I realized I create a cycle for myself that was both the symptom and the excuse. And I was rather tired of excuses. I want to say also, obviously, not all of this will apply to everyone. But I’ve seen a lot of posts about this recently and I think culturally we’ve just succumbed to it a bit more.

Difficulty Shifting Gears Keeps Me From My Hobbies,"Hey all, I've been noticing this trend and am unsure if this is an ADHD thing or not. I'll often avoid engaging in enjoyable activities or my hobbies until its in a way that feels ""perfect"" which usually leaves me waiting forever and feeling like a workaholic. For example, I had a client cancel and unexpectedly have an hour free in the middle of my workday. I hate it! I've been wanting to continue a painting but haven't had that ""perfect"" time line up and am getting more irritated the longer it takes to finish. What's keeping me from doing it now is that it will take me \~20 minutes to set up and then clean up the paint stuff, and another 5 minutes to get logged back in and set up, meaning I get maybe 35 minutes of actual painting time.

ADHD stops me doing the things I love,"Has anyone else had that stuck feeling, kind of paralysis, that not only stops you doing the things you need to do but also the things you love doing.

Like any other ADHD person, I have hyperfixations and obsessive bouts, that eventually wane. However, there are a few things I'm genuinely passionate about, not just hobbies that come and go. My issue is when I'm in that stuck/paralysis feeling, I stop doing the things I'm passionate about, I just brain rot in front of screens or take naps. 

For example, I actually love studying, but I always put it off and procrastinate. When I'm finally forced to study because there's an exam the next day, I realise how much I enjoy it. I think to myself ""wow this is actually really fun, why was I putting it off all this time"". I absolutely love yoga and meditation, but I rarely actually do it. I find myself lying in bed thinking about how nice, relaxing, and calming it would be. But I'm just stuck, paralysed, almost numb.

It’s probably because I used to hyperfocus intensely on things I liked and avoided anything that wasn’t generating enough interest, like the stuff I *need* to do.

So we went on Vyvance (Elvanse) after 1-2 months which was AMAZING for me.

At the time, it was a welcome side effect as I was planning on dieting for my wedding anyway, and I was slightly overweight before. I went from 73kg to 57kg and feel pretty good in my body. I don't have crazy bloatings anymore, as I used to have, I guess it also helps with inflammation.

Can anyone relate and how you over came?,"
Im 27 years old, I've been a quiet kid all my entire life. I dont know how to behave like a human. When I talk to anyone, I can't even hold conversation for even a minute, 
Lately I'm vising my office, I'm trying to have some conversations with my colleagues, I notice I always ask questions, I can't able to provide any value to others.

Also I observed, I don't really enjoy any conversation, I just talk to people for the sake. I'm feeling like I'm forcing my self to talk, and at the end, I don't really enjoy.   What happened to me, why my brain is so numb?

Why my brain is not rewarding me for being expressive to others. I'm really in a tough situation.

Anyone felt same as me or overcame this?",7,neurodiversity,https://reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1pkxz8c/can_anyone_relate_and_how_you_over_came/,Seeking Advice

I’m 19, soon to be 20. For the past about 7 years I have been suffering mentally. Mostly alone. I have become severely depersonalized. 

I tried to get help once. It did not go very well and I blocked myself off again emotionally from everyone. I went to therapy, got put on different anxiety meds and SSRIs which in turn did nothing. I was already too numb to life. Yet my mind never just shuts up.

I struggle the most with social anxiety. It has ruined me. Every single time I have to interact with anyone I dont know, I mentally shut down and go into an autopilot. No stuttering. No stumbling over my thoughts. Just nothing. It makes me inhuman. I never leave the house. No job. Can’t drive.

I want to know if anyone else has had a negative experience with this book when it comes to its use in autism diagnosis.

The bad place, unfortunately, is where they used the book (during my second testing day more specifically).

Being around people is torture,"I don’t think I can even explain this properly.

It’s like once someone’s eyes are on me, if they even know I’m around, my body tenses up and I feel uncomfortable. 

Talking and interacting with them has to be kept short, and it almost is never worth it trying to talk to people. I’ll maybe find one or two every six months that I actually enjoy engaging with, but most human interactions either leave me uncomfortable or numb.

The only people I do tend to relate to are those who aren’t normal themselves. It just feels…easier talking with them. Still, even then talking is a challenge, but it’s not uncomfortable, just draining.

I thought after years of talking to people I’d get more comfortable or find some secret code to human behavior, but it’s not that easy. Whatever it is that enables others to talk and commune together, even if awkwardly at first, I don’t have it.

2. My executive function actually got worse.

3. My speech became scattered; I found myself talking without thinking. The words are messed up in order.
4. My face flushed and I felt really hot.

5. The calorie dense food tastes extremely good and enjoyable. Normally I’ll feel it’s too rich and greasy then I’ll stop, but under the drug I never felt like that.

6. It’s been 24hrs. But I still feel very detached. I have an irrational fear when being around people and don’t know what to say and don’t look them in their eyes like I’m autistic.

My daily dose is 20mg, but even then I felt functional with just 10mg.

Got diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago, and it was like someone finally handed me the user manual for my brain… except it was in another language, missing pages, and occasionally burst into flames.

I tried Vyvanse and Adderall—aka the brain power-ups that come with a side of existential numbness.

* I enjoy spicy food (Chinese, Georgian, Serbian, Vietnamese cuisines).
* I experience physical pain in a “muffled” way, as if it’s distant.
* When someone disappears from my life, I don’t feel much. Even if they mattered to me a lot, it usually takes only a week or two for the feeling to wear off.

Quest to absorb the diagnosis [M/29],"# History:

In 2019, there was a suspicion of neurodivergence (ADHD). Nothing was done at the time; the neuropsychological assessment never happened due to financial reasons, and it was simply left unresolved. Fast forward to 2024: mental collapse, severe depressive episodes with suicidal ideation, anxiety, etc. The question resurfaced, this time on my part, but the psychiatrist ignored it and just prescribed me a bunch of medications. After many events, in 2025, I got involved with a neurodivergent person and started noticing certain things that felt strangely familiar, although my level of self-awareness back then was low. Between moments of clarity and breakdowns, I began to truly notice myself, and before I completely fell apart, I went back to the same neurologist from 2019, and he ordered the assessment again.

Usually, my hyperfixations don't die out. Rather, I stumble across something else that completely captures my interest— dethroning, if you will, the previous hyperfixation.

However, it's incredibly hard to move onto something new. It's as if your partner, who you have known and loved for decades, has died, and you somehow have to psych yourself up and go back into the world again. It's a numb, desperate, scary experience.

Need clarity,"
Hey, I’m 18M, and I suspect myself of having alexithymia (undiagnosed). I’m trying to understand what’s happening to me.

I grew up extremely logical. Emotions didn’t register at all, no fear, no excitement, no sadness. I couldn’t feel my body properly either (hunger, temperature, emotions… nothing). Social interactions felt blank and draining, and after anything slightly stressful I needed hours to “reset.”

In 9th grade, I had a pretty bad situation with close friends that basically killed the remaining emotional part of me. I taught myself to never be vulnerable, and on the outside I looked normal, but internally everything shut down.

For years, the only “emotion” I could feel was goosebumps and only when I consciously thought about what I should be feeling. Nothing ever came naturally.

choosing weed over adhd meds?,"ik that sounds like a dumb question but hear me out. im a 20 year old about to enter my second year of college as an engineering student and this summer ive been dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety leading to me isolating in my room. ive also felt completely numb to emotions for years and ive definitely had some level of dissociation from reality. anyways, i recently noticed about 4 days ago that when i smoke weed alone it helps me feel emotions clearer, work through my thoughts, feel grounded in reality, and just generally helps me feel real. this has lead to me making tiny improvements in my own life and my relationship with my mom and brother is better (i can have genuine conversations and ill do nice things for them). ive been spending less time on my phone scrolling, my screen time went down from like 8 hour average to 4, and ive been actually learning about things im interested in. im still not being super productive, but at least its getting me off my ass and i have mot",2,ADHDers,https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1n82yoe/choosing_weed_over_adhd_meds/,Seeking Advice

On the inside I am collapsing but on the outside I look fine: I wake up, go to school and do sports and I can be happy. I long so desperately for some free time that I allow myself to enjoy, I haven't felt that in a year. My parents say to try harder/""just do it"" and I feel so ashamed, because know I have to but I don'",20,ADHDers,https://reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1klv59s/is_it_possible_to_have_a_burnout_without_doing/,Fed Up
