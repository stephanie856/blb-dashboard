She just can't take it any more. She says my ADHD has become worse and feels \"loud.\" I feel terrible, and I'm seeing a therapist, taking medication, setting alarms and reminders and calendars and everything I can think of, but I fear it's not enough.\n\nI recently got in trouble at work for overlooking things I should have noticed, and it's not the first time this has happened. I'm chronically under-employed and making about 20 bucks an hour at 3 jobs (one full-time, 2 part time) in the highest cost-of-living area in the country. I'm in my 40s and still live with family in a leaky trailer because the rent they charge is something I can actually pay.\n\nI'm struggling to go back to school and complete a degree.

When I'm finally forced to study because there's an exam the next day, I realise how much I enjoy it. I think to myself \"wow this is actually really fun, why was I putting it off all this time\".
