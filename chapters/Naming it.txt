Notice: This is a Lived Experience Archive

If you found this on a subway seat, or if you were handed a fragment of this file cabinet because I thought you could handle it, read carefully.  

To my Family and Friends:

If you see yourself in these pages, you might feel exposed. You might feel like I’ve been “keeping receipts” or that I’m being “too much”. You might even feel like I’m “punishing” you for things you didn’t mean to do.  

But here is the math:

This isn’t a betrayal of you; it’s a documentation of me.  For years, I used “stillness” to keep you comfortable, while I was “sinking in emotional quicksand”.  I “curated a dream life” for you while my own humanity remained “invisible”.  

If you are angry reading this, I dare you to ask yourself if you’re mad at the truth, or just mad that the performance is over.  

To anyone I’ve let into Phase 2

You met the “Carnival-boat version” of me, and it was electric. But this archive is the “manual” for the parts that usually “ghost out of self-preservation”.  
If “all of me” is “too much” for your “snack capacity,” that’s okay.  
I’d rather you “lose interest” in the truth than “love” a mask that’s currently “eroding my soul”.  

To the Professional World:

This is my “resume in drag” finally being retired. If my “accuracy” or “justice sensitivity” feels like a “God Complex,” it’s actually just a “seatbelt” I used because I didn’t grow up somewhere safe.  

The Bottom Line:
I’m not here to earn your sympathy, and I’m definitely not here to “coddle” the people who see themselves as the villain. I’m just finally using my own microphone.  
Just be nice. Or don’t. The door is finally unlocked, and I’m no longer holding the handle.

These lived experiences have given me a name for something I couldn’t previously articulate well.

I call it. The Glitter Theory.

Glitter Theory: An artistic theory of invisible labor and visible residue.

Glitter is
Eye-catching. Temporary. Disposable. Used to distract. To dazzle. To make something violent feel beautiful. To make something average seem expensive and desirable.

It sticks to you until you’re inconvenienced. Then suddenly, it’s a mess, swept up, hidden, apologized for. Not because it did anything wrong, but because its presence is no longer useful. Its residue becomes annoying. And annoyance is enough to erase something once celebrated.

Glitter Theory proposes that, for many neurodivergent individuals, social and professional success is not the result of ease or adaptation, rather the residue of immense, unacknowledged effort. Much like glitter, this effort appears decorative, light, or excessive to the casual observer, but it clings to everything, resists cleanup, and reveals where someone has been; even when they tried to hide it.

The theory reframes “sparkle” (charisma, cleverness, productivity) as evidence of overexertion, and challenges the neurotypical gaze that mistakes survival strategies for personality traits. In this framework, glitter is both proof and burden, a mark of brilliance and a reminder of what was required to be seen as competent, likeable, or enough.

To follow the glitter is to trace the labor that was never meant to be visible.

With glitter. Beauty is the invitation 

Brokenness is the reveal.
