When I finally met someone, she met the Carnival-boat version of me. Loud, electric, laughing. That is me. But it’s not the whole story. The truth is, my baseline is flat. Ahedonic. Sometimes bordering on catatonic. The engine runs, but only on idle.
Ahedonia: The reduced ability or complete inability to experience pleasure from activities that were once found enjoyable, and it often involves a loss of interest or motivation in daily life.
Catatonic: Refers to a neuropsychiatric syndrome known as catatonia, characterized by abnormal movement, speech, and behavior, often presenting as severe unresponsiveness, immobility, or withdrawal in a person who is otherwise awake. It is a state in which a person appears awake but does not respond to people or surroundings normally.

It’s not coldness, it’s freeze. I’m not lazy, I’m in a functional coma. I do the minimum required to get through each day because my body has been in shut down mode for years. After back to back traumas in every corner of my life, I never got the chance to stabilize. No single safe place to land. My nervous system adapted by numbing out. That is why it takes something as massive and overstimulating as Carnival to wake me up, to temporarily thaw me out.

Sprinkle in neurodiversity, sprinkle in demisexuality, and my affect is flat as hell. What looks like indifference is actually conservation. I’m surviving on low power mode. And survival is not a quick fix. You don’t pop an Advil and reboot. It is more like a long course of antibiotics, paired with rehab, paired with lifestyle overhaul.

The things I love still matter, but joy only punches through in extreme doses. Small pleasures barely register. That is not me choosing to be detached. It is my brain’s wiring after years of consecutive hits.

The Invisibility of Neurodiversity

Neurodiversity is another layer of this. It is invisible in the same way chronic illness is. Most days it passes unnoticed until something slips. It is like asthma. As long as I pace myself, use the inhaler, avoid triggers, no one thinks twice. But if I do not manage it, suddenly I cannot breathe, and everyone notices. That is when it becomes an inconvenience to others.

It is like migraines. I can look perfectly fine, then suddenly I am in a dark room, unable to function. People forget the daily management and only see the crash.

That is what living with neurodiversity feels like. Constant adjustments. Constant masking. Constant apologies for being myself. I bend toward norms to stay invisible, because the minute I stop managing it, the invisible becomes visible. And when it becomes visible, people treat it not as reality, but as disruption.


The Missing Home Base

Psychologists like John Bowlby, who developed attachment theory, wrote about the need for a secure base. For children, that is usually parents or a childhood home. It is the sense that, no matter where you wander, you can look back and know someone’s got you. It does not mean you never leave. It means you feel tethered and safe while you explore.

Adults need that too. The secure base shifts. It might be a partner, a family, a community, even a city that feels like home. But it has to exist somewhere. Without it, the nervous system is like a compass with no north.

The verdict is still out on exactly how long it takes most adults to build a a secondary secure attachment. What I do know is that it takes me double, even triple the time of the average person. That is my reality, and it is especially unfortunate being someone who has lost every version of a secure base several times over. What research does show with confidence is that having close, secure relationships is positively correlated with psychological well-being. They are protective factors for long-term emotional stability. They even have measurable health impacts, like longer and healthier lives. But without one, survival rewires into hyper vigilance and freeze.

I had a base, then I lost it. I rebuilt it, then I lost that too. Every time, the rug ripped out. Add in multiple medical emergencies, none properly treated, all with lasting effects, and the rewiring got baked in somewhere along the way. Meningitis is the one that carved the deepest pit. It changed me forever, but only invisibly. No one notices, no one asks, because I look fine. Being an adult who survived meningitis is the ultimate back left burner situation. If I had been a child survivor, the scars would have been documented, named, given grace. As an adult, I was expected to walk it off.

Invisible damage doesn’t earn empathy, or even sympathy. It just looks like weakness. So I built walls. Tall, begrudging, heavy walls. I have always wanted to let people in, but experience taught me it was dangerous. It is the psychological equivalent of knowing it is safer to wear track pants at 10 pm in a dark alley. Or having to choose a password that is next to impossible to remember. Society says we have to, or any harm experienced is our fault. Yet we know full well we are at risk either way. But for peace of mind, I comply. It is just easier.

Where That Leaves Me

So yes, my body looks frozen. My affect looks flat. But it is not because I do not care. It is because I have been running without a secure base for years, and my nervous system decided the only way to survive was to shut almost everything down.

What makes this harder is how it lands for others. From the outside I look “totally fine,” or worse, I look cold, uncaring, distant, different, forgetful. Cruelest joke though is, I am forgetful, but not in the way it gets perceived. The truth is, if something is not absolutely required for my survival that day, it will not make the to do list. That is not neglect by choice. That is conservation out of necessity. It means very little attention gets paid beyond the essentials, because that is all the capacity I have to spend.

What it reads as though is not texting back, canceling plans, forgetting people exist, emotionless responses. For most people these are occasional lapses. For me it has become the baseline. What looks like indifference is actually triage. And that misunderstanding is both understandable and deeply frustrating.

This is why I am on medical leave. Why I am moving back to Toronto. Why I make costumes. These are my ways of slowly rebuilding a base. It is slow work, frustrating work, but it is the only way I know.

And that is the state she walked into. Not a cold person, but a frozen one. Not someone who does not want to give, but someone still clawing toward a home base that can hold them without collapsing.
